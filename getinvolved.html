      Could you help a young person change their life and avoid reoffending after release from custody?
      <p>
      We have exciting opportunities available for committed, compassionate people to volunteer as one to one mentors with us at HMPYOI Feltham, London. One to one mentors will work with males, mainly those aged under 18 years, who have committed gang related offences and want to change their lives.
      <p>
      Mentors will build a professional working relationship with young people as they serve their custodial sentence and prepare for release into London communities. One to one mentoring sessions take place once per week or fortnight, for up to one hour per session. During the sessions volunteers will offer support to young people to assist them to access education, training and employment in and outside of custody and to build and maintain positive relationships. Volunteers need to be able to commit to the role for 9 - 12 months. Mentoring sessions with young people can take place on Mondays and Wednesdays from 8am to 5pm. Sessions can only occasionally take place during weekends.
      <p>
      Successful applicants will be invited to participate in two training courses. The first course comprises two days and normally takes place on two Saturdays. The second course normally takes place over one full weekday and one half weekday, with dates to be confirmed. All training takes place at HMPYOI Feltham. Prison security vetting and an enhanced DBS check is required for this role and all volunteers will be supported to undergo this.
      <p>
      Full support and supervision will be provided to volunteers.
